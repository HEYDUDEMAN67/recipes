		<p>A nice hearty recipe from smoked salmon.</p>
	<h2>What are the ingredients?</h2>

<li>4 pieces of salmon with skin on<li>

<li>2 tsp sea salt<li>

</li>2 tsp brown sugar<li>

</li>1 tsp dried lemon myrtle</li>

</li>1 tsp black pepper</li>

<h2>What are the steps?</h2>
<ol>
<li>In a small bowl, mix together the sea salt, brown sugar, dried lemon myrtle, and black pepper.</li>
<li>Rub the mixture evenly over the salmon pieces.</li>
<li>Place the salmon in the refrigerator and let it rest for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight</li>
<li>Preheat the smoker to 105째C (225째F). I used a gas grill with some wood chips soaked in water for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>When ready to smoke, place the salmon on a wooden board, skin side down (the board makes it easier to handle the fish).</li>
<li>Smoke the salmon for about an hour or until it reaches an internal temperature of 57째C (135째F).</li>
<li>Once done, remove the salmon from the smoker and let it cool for a few minutes.</li>
