		 <p>Who doesn't love garlic bread.</p>
		 <h2>What are the ingredients?</h2>
		 <li>Unsalted Butter: softened to room temperature to be easily whisked into a garlic butter sauce.</li>
	     <li>Minced Garlic: I highly recommend freshly minced garlic for the best flavor. Use a garlic press or follow any of these methods for minced garlic.</li>
	     <li>Grated Parmesan Cheese: add as much or as little as you like. I prefer to buy and grate a block but feel free to use a store-bought pre-shredded shortcut.</li>
		 <li>I always have dried basil on hand, so I use that. You can also use finely chopped fresh basil instead.</li>
		 <li>Baguette: sliced into ½-inch thick slices. I used only half a loaf for this recipe, which gives me roughly 10 slices.</li>

		 <h2>What are the steps?</h2>
		 <ol>
			<li>Cut the baguette into ½-inch thick slices.</li>
			<li>Combine the softened butter with minced garlic, parmesan cheese, parsley, and dried basil.</li>
			<li>Generously spread the mixture onto baguette slices.</li>
			<li>Place the garlic bread in a single layer in the air fryer basket, then air fry at 350ºF for 3-4 minutes for a softer texture or 5 minutes for golden crisp edges.</li>
